									<h2>My latest projects</a></h2>
									<p>My name is Murad Shukurzade and I am currently pursuing my BSc in Mechanical Engineering at Ihsan Dogramaci Bilkent University. 
										In this website, I demonstrate my latest projects that I have worked on with the help of my Mechanical Engineering knowledge, experience and skills that I have obtained throughout my education.

										<h2>Conceptualization and development of a District Heat Pump System by Utilizing waste heat generated from data centers
									</header>
									<a href="images/Project 1 Picture.png" class="image fit"><img src="images/Project 1 Picture.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>In this project, I was able to come up with a design of a district heat pump system while utilizing waste heat generated from a 
										data center environment as a heat input for the system with my team. The design was able to both serve as a cooling system for the data center rooms, 
										as well as a district heating system. By analyzing and simulating the real world Thermodynamic data from data centers with Siemens Simcenter AMESIM, we managed to calculate the 
										amount of flats that can be heated up, as well as cooled down throughout different seasons. Cost assesment and feasibility of a potential real-life application
										of this project was further discussed and evaluated. It was found out that the implementation of such project would not only prevent air pollution that may further lead to global warming,
										but also provide a significantly more economic feasibility for the residents after a certain period of time. The final report of this project 
									was constructed with the help of LaTeX document editor.</p>

										<h2>Computer Aided Design of a Dynamometer and its calibration device for Measuring Cutting Force
											Based on Strain Gauge
									</header>
									<a href="images/Screenshot 2024-02-11 034942-imageonline.co-merged.png" class="image fit"><img src="images/Screenshot 2024-02-11 034942-imageonline.co-merged.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The purpose of this project was to design a measurement device for a lathe machine cutting tool device and an electric gated weight calibration system.
										With my team, I was sucessfuly able to provide the SolidWorks design of the device, which its measurements were integrated from a real life sample, as well as a weight calibration system from scratch. 
										Moreover, a simulation of the cutting tool under a certain amount of stress from various directions were also analyzed and documented.</p>

										<h2>Bicycle Frame Project

									<p>The project's main goal was to design a small-scaled bicylce frame under specific requirements, and test its durability under a certain amount of load
										by utilizing a test setup. My team and I were able to design, develop, and manufacture a real life prototype of our design with the help of various software programmes, 
										such as SolidWorks, ANSYS Workbench, and UltiMaker Cura 3D printing software. We were able to understand the importance of small-scaled prototype testing and development in 
										mass production of large-scaled products, and its further potential applications for the purpose of time-cost feasibility, as well as dimensional optimization.  
										You may see "Full Paper" below for the detailed report and demonstrations of the final prototype.

										<h2>Spaghetti Crane Project 
											
									</header>
									<a href="images/Screenshot 2024-02-11 150132.png" class="image fit"><img src="images/Screenshot 2024-02-11 150132.png" alt="" /></a>
									<p>The objective of this project was to design a self-standing spaghetti crane that is able to lift and
										support a load using only a single pack of spaghettis, as well as an adhesive of a team's choice. The structure was designed and analyzed
										with SolidWorks and Matlab before its construction. However, we went through some challenges in developing the Matlab simulation of 
										the crane under different loads since the code that we were provided with had some flaws. Nevertheless, with various testing and improvements,
										we were successfuly able to construct the crane.
